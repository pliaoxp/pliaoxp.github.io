We consider  continuous-time models with a large panel of moment conditions, where the structural parameter depends on a set of  characteristics, whose effect is of interest. The leading example is the   linear factor model  in financial economics where  factor betas depend on observed characteristics such as firm specific instruments and macroeconomic variables, and   their effect  picks up long-run time-varying beta fluctuations. We  specify the  factor betas as the sum of  characteristic effects and an orthogonal idiosyncratic  parameter that captures high-frequency movements. It  is often the case that researchers do not  know whether or not the latter exists, or its strengths, and thus the inference about the characteristic effect  should be valid uniformly over  a  broad class of data generating processes  for idiosyncratic parameters. We construct our estimation and inference in a two-step continuous-time GMM framework.   It is found that   the limiting distribution of the estimated characteristic effect has a discontinuity when the variance  of the idiosyncratic parameter is near the boundary (zero), which makes   the usual ``plug-in" method using  the estimated asymptotic variance only  valid pointwise and may produce either over- or under- coveraging probabilities. We show that  the uniformity can be achieved by  cross-sectional bootstrap. Our procedure allows both known and estimated factors, and  also features a bias correction for the effect of estimating unknown factors.
