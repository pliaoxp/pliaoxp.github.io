Estimations and applications of factor models often rely on the crucial condition that the number of factors  is consistently estimable,  which in turn also requires that  factors   be relatively strong, data are stationary, and the sample size  be fairly large, although in practical applications, one or several of these conditions may fail. In these cases it is  difficult to analyze the eigenvectors of the original data matrix.  To address this issue, we propose simple estimates of the factors  using cross-sectional  projections of the original datasets, by  weighted averages with pre-determined  weights. These  weights are chosen to diversify away the idiosyncratic  components,  resulting in ``diversified factors".  Because the projection is conducted cross-sectionally,  it is also robust to serial dependence conditions. We  formally prove that  this procedure is  robust to over-estimating the number of factors, and  illustrate it  in several  applications.   We also recommend several choices for the diversified weights. When they are randomly generated from a known distribution,  we show that the estimated factor components are nearly  optimal in terms of recovering the low-rank structure of the factor model.

<P>  Scenario I: The high dimensional control variables X have a factor structure with r=2 factors. R is the used number of factors for Diversified Projection (DP). "double selection" uses double Lasso directly on X without estimating factors.
