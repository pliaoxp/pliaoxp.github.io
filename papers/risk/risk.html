The risk of a large portfolio is often estimated by substituting a good estimator of the volatility matrix. However, the accuracy of such a risk estimator   is largely unknown.  We study   factor-based risk estimators under a large amount of assets, and introduce a  high-confidence level upper bound (H-CLUB)  to assess the   estimation. The H-CLUB is constructed using the confidence interval of risk estimators with either known or unknown factors.  We derive the limiting distribution of the estimated risks in high dimensionality.  We find that  when the dimension is large, the factor-based risk estimators have the same asymptotic variance no matter whether the factors are known or not, which  is  slightly  smaller than that of the sample covariance-based estimator. Numerically, H-CLUB  outperforms the traditional crude bounds, and provides an insightful risk assessment. In addition,  our simulated results quantify the relative error in the risk estimation, which is usually negligible using 3-month daily data.
